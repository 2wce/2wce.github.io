Hey, I'm Kudakwashe Mupeni, a software developer from Zimbabwe. I started coding in 2015, and it's been my thing ever since. I love TypeScript, DevOps, and all things serverless. On my blog, I'm all about sharing cool and easy-to-understand ideas on these topics. Join me in making tech simple and fun!
